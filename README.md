# Open Source TRIRIGA JavaScript SDK

This is an unofficial SDK for TRIRIGA which aims to support development of
backend and frontend code written in JavaScript or TypeScript. The goal of this
project is to simplify, document and expose the available APIs with few
dependencies. If you are looking into UI components, then please stick to the
official IBM
[tririga-react-components ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tririga/tririga-react-components)
library.

# Getting Started

The goal of this library is to remain lightweight with few dependencies. This
library can be used with backend NodeJS applications or any frontend frameworks
such as Svelte Kit, React, or Vue.

# Installation

Simply install this library with the following command:

```
npm install tririga-js-sdk
```

# Environment Requirements

Please refer to the class documents on platform version requirements. Certain
features are only available on bleeding edge (e.g. 4.2+) platforms.

# Contribute

## Individual

Please take a look at the issues list and submit a PR. I would also appreciate
any feedback on future feature requests.

## Corporate

Due to the nature of IBM TRIRIGA, I can't simply run tests on existing
environments. This library has been written using my existing knowledge of the
system as well as basic user access to the official IBM beta environment. If you
are an existing TRIRIGA system owner or IBM partner and would like to provide
this project access to an environment for integration tests, please
[contact me](mailto:amir@karbasi.dev).
